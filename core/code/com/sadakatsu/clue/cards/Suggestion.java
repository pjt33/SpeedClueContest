/**
 * The Suggestion class represents three important and similar Clue concepts:
 * solution, suggestion, and accusation.   The purpose of Clue is to determine
 * who killed Mr. Boddy with what and where.  This is a tuple of Suspect,
 * Weapon, and Room.  The game's solution, the suggestions the players make each
 * turn, and the accusations raised when players try to win all have this same
 * structure.  Since suggestions are the most commonly referenced concept when
 * playing Clue, "Suggestion" was chosen as the name for the structure for all
 * three.
